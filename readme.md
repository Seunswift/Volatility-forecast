Stock Price Volatility Forecasting using GARCH Model
This project aims to predict the volatility of stock prices using the GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) model, which is widely used in finance for modeling time series with changing variances.

Project Overview
Stock price volatility is a measure of the price variation or risk associated with a stock. In this project, we use the GARCH model to forecast stock price volatility based on historical stock data. This project covers:

Data pre-processing: Preparing and cleaning stock price data.
Modeling: Implementing and tuning the GARCH model for volatility forecasting.
Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the model.
Dataset
The dataset used includes historical stock price data containing:

Open, High, Low, Close prices
Trading Volume
Date
You can obtain the data from sources like Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or any relevant financial APIs.

Methodology
Data Pre-processing: Clean and prepare stock price data by handling missing values, and calculate daily returns from stock prices.
Feature Engineering: Compute daily log returns, which serve as the primary input for the GARCH model.
Modeling: Apply the GARCH model to estimate and forecast volatility.
Evaluation: Evaluate the model's accuracy using backtesting techniques and error metrics like RMSE.
GARCH Model
GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) is a model used for time series data where the variance of the error terms changes over time. It is especially effective for predicting financial time series volatility.

The GARCH model captures two key components:

Autoregression (AR): Incorporates past volatility into the current period's volatility forecast.
Conditional Heteroskedasticity (CH): Models the varying volatility over time, providing better estimates for financial returns.
In this project, we use the arch package to fit and forecast volatility using the GARCH(1,1) model, which is commonly used in practice.
